# Hospital Management System
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2ad9ec-762f-4848-973d-24162a22a7c8)
## Overview
This project is a hospital management system designed to streamline the operations of hospitals by managing patient admissions, appointments, doctor registrations, and invoice generation. The system features three main roles: Admin, Doctor, and Patient, each with distinct functionalities.

## Default Credentials

- **Admin:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin12345`

## Functions

### Admin
- Signup for an account and log in (No approval required).
- Register, view, approve, reject, and delete doctors (approve those doctors who applied for jobs in their hospital).
- Admit, view, approve, reject, and discharge patients (discharge patients when treatment is done).
- Generate and download invoice PDFs (according to medicine costs, room charges, doctor fees, and other charges).
- View, book, and approve appointments (approve those appointments which are requested by patients).

### Doctor
- Apply for a job in the hospital and log in (Approval required by hospital admin before the doctor can log in).
- View their assigned patients' details (symptoms, name, mobile).
- View the list of discharged patients (approved by admin).
- View their appointments, booked by the admin.
- Delete their appointments after attending to them.

### Patient
- Create an account to be admitted to the hospital and log in (Approval required by hospital admin before the patient can log in).
- View their assigned doctor's details (specialization, mobile, address).
- View the status of their booked appointments (pending/confirmed by admin).
- Book appointments (approval required by admin).
- View and download invoice PDFs (only after being discharged by admin).

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository into a folder :
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hospitial_system
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Set the execution policy (Windows PowerShell only):
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```
6. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Make migrations and migrate the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
8. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
9. Open your browser and enter the following URL:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

## Create Superuser
To create a superuser account for the admin, run the following command:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set the username and password.

## Changes Required for Contact Us Page
In `settings.py`, add your email and password:
```python
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'youremail@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your email password'
EMAIL_RECEIVING_USER = 'youremail@gmail.com'
```
Login to Gmail through your host email ID in your browser and enable access for less secure apps:
```
https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
```

## Drawbacks/LoopHoles
- Anyone can become an Admin. There is no approval process for the admin account. You may disable admin signup and create a superuser instead.
- There should be at least one doctor in the hospital before admitting a patient. Make sure to add a doctor first.
- On the update page for doctor/patient, you must update the password.
